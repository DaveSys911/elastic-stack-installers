### Failed Installations

If you are reporting an issue that occurred during installation, we ask that you
attach the installation log file to your issue to help diagnose the root cause.

The log file can be found in the %TEMP% directory with a randomly generated name adhering to the format MSI<random>.LOG. It should be the most recent log file.

When installing from the command-line, the log file can be captured by passing the /l*v <logfilename>
flag as per the documentation:
